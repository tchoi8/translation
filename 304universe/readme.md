Notes 


This is an impeccable song about the victims of the [sinking of Sewol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_MV_Sewol) in South Korea, 2014. There estimated 304 victims who lost their life or missing from the tragic incident. 

In translating this lyric, I'm thinking about using persons for 사람들 instead of more grammatically correct people. Also, the universe may already contain plurality (as in this [conversation notes](http://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/8657/universe-or-universes)), I'm inclined to use 'universes' to emphasize the individual universe that is person.
